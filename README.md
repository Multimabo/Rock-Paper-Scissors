# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Here's a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python where you play against the computer. It uses the random library to generate the computer's choice:

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a hand game for two players where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: rock (a closed fist), paper (a flat hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle finger extended). Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same shape, it's a tie, and the round is repeated.
